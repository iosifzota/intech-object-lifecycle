# Constructors, destructors
* RAII
* Delegating Constructors

# Copy, Move
* Rules for compiler generated functions
* Rule of three: destructor + copy constructor + copy assignment operator (if any from the list is defined then probably all three should be defined)
* Rule of five: rule of 3 + move constructor + move assignment (only if move is needed for the class) (unlike the rule of three failing to provide the move imples only a loss in performance)
* Rvalue vs Rvalue reference
